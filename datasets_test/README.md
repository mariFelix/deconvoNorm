These datasets are provided to test the deconvoNorm script. Use ChIP-seq_TAF68.bam as the IP and ChIP-seq_Input.bam as the input.


The resulting file should be the same as the file ChIP-seq_TAF68_deconvoNorm.bedgraph.


To visualize the data, you have to upload MmrDNA+35 (see rDNA folder) as a genome on IGV and then upload the normalized data.
